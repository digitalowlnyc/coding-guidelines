# Coding and Project Guidelines

# Projects
## Naming
Project names should start with uppercase and use hyphens for separation, for example `My-New-Project`

# Source Control
## Commit comments
* Use **+/-** to indicate removing or adding something, for example `+Readme file` or `-Bad syntax in for loops`
* Use **&** to separate different parts of the commit message, for example `Refactored logins & moved configs & implemented test cases`
* Use `See last commit` if you accidentally left out portions of a previous commit
